A community portal for fake news detection from social media websities.

The database is available throught the url and it was being hosted on localhost:3306 need to change that configuration from application.properties file

Database name is : fake_detect 
Which is a mysql database
The username is : username
And the password is : password

Everything has been configured properly.

front end uses localhost:3000 for hosting and assumes that the backend server is running on port 8080. Need to remember that.

The threshold value generator(webhook) is running on port 5000.
